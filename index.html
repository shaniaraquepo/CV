                <p>The history of computers is extensive and fascinating! Explore how computers were invented over thousands of years and how they became the ever-present machines we rely on today. Their evolution and history make me even more optimistic about the future.</p>
                <br>
                <p>The earliest computers were little more than counting tools from millennia ago but as humanity faced new challenges, they adapted and will continue to do so going forward. It wasn’t until the 20th century that we saw computers that resemble today’s machines with the last 50 years seeing unprecedented progress. Today, computers are everywhere and it’s hard to imagine a world without them.</p>

            <p>Computers are all around us, and they play an important role in our lives. But what exactly is a computer? We're going to answer that question and give you an overview of some of the different types of computers you might use. </p>
            <br>
            <p>A computer is an electronic device that manipulates information, or data. It has the ability to store, retrieve, and process data. You may already know that you can use a computer to type documents, send email, play games, and browse the Web. You can also use it to edit or create spreadsheets, presentations, and even videos.</p>

            <p>Hardware and software are two terms you've probably heard of at some point or another. The odds are high that you use both on a daily basis, whether it's with your smartphone or personal computer. Let's take a deeper look at what these two things are and why they're important.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Hardware is any element of a computer that's physical. This includes things like monitors, keyboards, and also the insides of devices, like microchips and hard drives.</p>
            <p>Software is anything that tells hardware what to do and how to do it, including computer programs and apps on your phone. Video games, photo editors, and web browsers are just a few examples.</p>

                <p>Analogue Computers are designed to process the analogue data. Analogue data is continuous data that changes continuously and cannot have discrete values such as speed, temperature, pressure and current.</p>
                <p>Digital Computer is designed to perform calculations and logical operations at high speed. It accepts the raw data as digits or numbers and processes it with programs stored in its memory to produce output.</p>
                <p>Hybrid Computer has features of both analogue and digital computer. It is fast like analogue computer and has memory and accuracy like digital computers. It can process both continuous and discrete data.</p>

            <p>We are all aware of what computers are and their immense importance in our daily lives. It is an electronic device that not only stores data but also processes and manipulates data to carry out functions. Upon receiving valid instructions, a computer can perform a variety of operations.</p>
            <br>
            <p>What allows us to perform such tasks on the computer is a computer system. A computer system is the sum total of all the components (hardware and software) that makes up a fully functional computer.</p>

        <div class="description">
            <p>Ensure that employees are properly trained in the safe use of hand tools. Always provide training on how to choose the right tool for the job, how to correctly use each tool, and how to identify when tools need repair.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Inspect tools for defects before use. Replace or repair defective tools. Keep cutting tools sharp and cover sharp edges with a suitable covering to protect the tool and to prevent injuries from unintended contact. Replace cracked, splintered, or broken handles on files, hammers, screwdrivers, or sledges.</p>

            <p>In order to install an operating system on a computer, a CD that contains the operating system is needed, and these CDs usually come with the computer. Buy an operating system CD at a store to ensure that it is legally licensed with help from a software developer in this free video on computer operating systems.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The steps for installing an operating system, like Linux or Microsoft Windows, depending on the operating system version you are installing.
